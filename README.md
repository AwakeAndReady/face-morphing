# Morphing Two Images

Using a triangular mesh based on chosen reference points, barycentric coordinates for the target coordinate matrix, and adjustable interpolation type.

Use these two main scripts:
1. prepare_data.mlx: Selection of reference points with the Control Point Selection Tool® (MATLAB®).
2. mesh_based_morphing.mlx: Performing the morphing with various options.

Both main programs also contain instructions. 
The HTML version of the mlx files is located in the "documentation" folder.
